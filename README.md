# Day to day scripts

Scripts to help at that moments we need to use some command line often not used and we forget sintaxe or when we are too lazy to write all over again ðŸ˜¬.

The 'initial_config_for_bash.sh' is the main one, which installs and configure some packages and softwares we might forget when we want to prepare our bash terminal ðŸ˜ƒ.

PS: Tested on MacOS and Ubuntu, you can try run it on WSL2 if you are brave enough ðŸ‘€.
